## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis & Assessment
- [x] Clone all repositories
- [ ] Analyze each tool's architecture and dependencies
- [ ] Identify integration points and data models
- [ ] Assess compatibility with UnifiedOps framework

### Phase 2: Integration Planning
- [ ] Design unified data models
- [ ] Plan API integration strategy
- [ ] Design component embedding approach
- [ ] Plan authentication and authorization integration

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Create integration adapters for each tool
- [ ] Implement unified data fetching
- [ ] Embed tool components in respective tabs
- [ ] Implement cross-tool data sharing

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Test integrated functionality
- [ ] Validate data consistency across tools
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor performance and user feedback

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Completed**:
- All repositories cloned successfully
- Deal Flow tab added to navigation
- Deal Flow page component created
- Routing configured for Deal Flow
- Airtable configuration updated for dealflow views

üîÑ **In Progress**:
- Tool analysis and assessment

‚è≥ **Next Steps**:
- Analyze each tool's codebase
- Design integration architecture
- Begin implementation of tool embedding

## Notes

- Each tool maintains its own repository for independent development
- Integration will be done through component embedding and API unification
- Data models will be standardized across all tools
- Authentication will be unified through the existing RBAC system
